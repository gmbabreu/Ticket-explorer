# Ticket-explorer

A web scraping program that goes through online sources to explore and search for flights worldwide under a given budget. The budget and the leaving airport must be written in manually in the file. There is a sample file included with all the values filled in for all flights from Boston for less than $400. There is also a variable for scratch locations, all locations that you want to be filtered out of the search.
