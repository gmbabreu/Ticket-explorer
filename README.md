# Ticket-explorer

A web scraping program that goes through online sources (Google Flights, Skyscanner, and Kayak) to explore and search for flights worldwide under a given budget. The budget and the leaving airport must be written in manually in the file. There is also a variable for scratch locations, refering to all locations that you want to be filtered out of the search. All results are written into a txt file.
There is a sample file included with all the values filled in for all flights from Boston for less than $400.
